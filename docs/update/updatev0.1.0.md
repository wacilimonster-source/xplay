# XFlow - Initial Release

XFlow is a Flutter-based application that reimagines how you consume media from Twitter/X. It provides a seamless, TikTok-style infinite scrolling experience specifically tailored for browsing videos, images, and GIFs from the platform.

By leveraging the robust authentication and data layers originally built for the [Squawker](https://github.com/j-fb/squawker) project, XFlow allows you to securely log in, view media from your subscriptions, and explore trending content in a highly optimized, full-screen player environment.

## ✨ Features

* **TikTok-Style Media Feed:** Infinite vertical scrolling through full-screen media content.
* **Smart Pre-caching:** Automatically warms up the next few videos in your feed so playback starts instantly without buffering.
* **Subscription Management:** Easily manage your X/Twitter subscriptions and view a dedicated feed of their media.
* **Profile & Media Grid:** View user profiles and lazily-loaded grids of their media uploads.
* **Optimized Caching:** Implements `ffcache` and `cached_network_image` to aggressively cache API responses and media assets, dramatically reducing network requests and improving load times.
* **State Preservation:** Keeps your place in the infinite scroll feed even when navigating deep into user profiles or switching tabs.
