# XFlow — Update v0.2.0

## Summary

This release marks the project version `0.2.0` and bundles several player, feed, caching, and profile improvements focused on rendering reliability, media prefetching, and developer tooling.

## Highlights

- **Rendering & player:** Improved video rendering (wrapped `TiktokMediaContainer` in `RepaintBoundary`) and stabilized the player pool and prefetch logic (`lib/features/player/`, `lib/features/feed/`).
- **Feed & parsing:** Added timeline fetching helpers and improved tweet/date parsing to support more robust feed display and overlays.
- **Caching & performance:** Aggressive media and response caching using `ffcache`, `cached_network_image`, and local caching strategies to reduce buffering and network usage.
- **Profile & subscriptions:** Enhanced profile media display, feature flags for profile label improvements, subscription import and management screens.
- **Developer & CI:** Added `AppLogger` and `LogViewerScreen` for diagnostics and a GitHub Actions workflow for automated APK builds.
